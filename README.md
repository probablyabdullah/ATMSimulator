# ATMSimulator
**A simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. It allows users to perform various transactions such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash, checking balance, and changing their PIN.**

This is an implementation of an ATM simulator using the C programming language. It aims to replicate the functionality of a real ATM machine by allowing users to perform various banking operations. The program begins by displaying a logo and prompting the user to enter their PIN for authentication.

Once authenticated, the user is presented with a menu of available transactions such as cash withdrawal, cash deposit, balance check, and PIN change. The program then prompts the user to select the desired transaction and provides relevant options or inputs accordingly.

To enhance the user experience, the code includes functions for displaying available denominations for cash withdrawal, handling PIN entry securely, and generating receipts for transactions. It also maintains account balances and ensures that withdrawal and deposit operations are performed accurately, updating both the account and ATM balances accordingly.

Overall, this code serves as a simplified representation of an ATM system, offering basic functionalities that are typically found in real-world ATMs.
